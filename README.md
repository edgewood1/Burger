This is a project_list application. 

It allows users to add a series of projects to a list of completed or uncompleted projects, and it uses mysql to store this list. 

The browser prevents a user from submitting an empty task.

When a task is submitted, it can be placed in either the completed or uncompleted stack.

Tasks may be switched from one stack to the other, or they may be deleted.
